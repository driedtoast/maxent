We have tried to make the quipu.maxent implementation easy to use.&nbsp;
To create a model, one needs (of course) the training data, and then implementations
of two interfaces in the quipu.maxent package, EventStream and ContextGenerator.&nbsp;
These have fairly simple specifications, and example implementations can
be found in the <a href="http://grok.sourceforge.net">OpenNLP Grok Library</a>
preprocessing components.&nbsp; More details are given in the quipu.maxent
<a href="howto.html">HOWTO</a>.
<p>We have also set in place some interfaces and code to make it easier
to automate the training and evaluation process (the Evalable interface
and the TrainEval class).&nbsp; It is not necessary to use this functionality,
but if you do you'll find it much easier to see how well your models are
doing.&nbsp; The quipu.grok.preprocess.namefind package is an example of
a maximum entropy component which uses this functionality.
<p>We have managed to use several techniques to reduce the size of the
models when writing them to disk, which also means that reading in a model
for use is much quicker than with less compact encodings of the model.&nbsp;
This was especially important to us since we use many maxent models in
the Grok library, and we wanted the start up time and the physical size
of the library to be as minimal as possible. As of version 1.2.0,
maxent has an io package which greatly simplifies the process of
loading and saving models in different formats.
<p>The opennlp.maxent package was built by <a href="http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~jmb/">Jason
Baldridge</a>, <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~tsmorton/">Tom Morton</a>,
and <a href="http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~gbierner">Gann Bierner</a>.&nbsp;
We owe a big thanks to <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/people/a/adwaitr/">Adwait
Ratnaparkhi</a> for his work on maximum entropy models for natural language
processing applications.&nbsp; His <a href="ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/ircs/tr/97-08.ps.Z">introduction
to maxent for NLP</a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.cis.upenn.edu/pub/ircs/tr/98-15/98-15.ps.gz">dissertation</a>
are what really made opennlp.maxent and our Grok maxent components
(POS tagger, end of sentence detector, tokenizer, name finder) possible!
