This is a simple example of a use of maximum entropy and the OpenNLP
Maxent toolkit.  (It was designed to work with Maxent v1.2.2.)  There
are two example data sets provided, one for whether a game should be
played indoors or outdoors and another for whether Arsenal or
Manchester United (two English football clubs) will win when they play
each other, based on a few potentially salient features for either
decision.

The java classes should be helpful getting up and running with your
own maxent implementation, though the context generator is about as
simple as it gets.  For more complex examples, look at the classes in
the opennlp.grok.preprocess package, available at http://grok.sf.net.

To play with this sample application, do the following:

Be sure that opennlp.maxent is in your classpath.

Compile the java files: 
   
> javac *.java

or

> jikes *.java

(If you have it installedon your system, jikes is faster!)

Build the models:

> java CreateModel gameLocation.dat
> java CreateModel football.dat

This will produce the two models "gameLocationModel.txt" and
"footballModel.txt" in this directory.

You can then test the models on the data itself to see what sort of
results they get on the data they were trained on:

> java Predict gameLocation.dat
> java Predict football.dat

You'll get output such as the following:

--------------------------------------------------
For context: Cloudy,Happy,Humid
Outdoor[0.77126]  Indoor[0.22873]

For context: Rainy,Sad,Humid
Outdoor[0.00193]  Indoor[0.99806]
--------------------------------------------------

For the first, the model has assigned a normalized probability of 77%
to the Outdoor outcome, so given the context "Cloudy,Happy,Humid" it
would choose to have the game outdoors.  For the second, the model
appears to be almost entirely sure that the game should be indoors.

The Arsenal vs. Manchester United decision is a bit more interesting
because there are three possible outcomes: Arsenal wins, ManU wins, or
they tie.  Here is some example output:

--------------------------------------------------
For context: home=man_united,Beckham=false,Scholes=true,Neville=true,Henry=false,Kanu=true,Parlour=false,Ferguson=confident,Wengler=confident,arsenal_won_previous,man_united_won_previous
arsenal[0.29334]  man_united[0.44398]  tie[0.26267]

For context: home=arsenal,Beckham=false,Scholes=true,Neville=true,Henry=true,Kanu=true,Parlour=false,Ferguson=tense,Wengler=tense,arsenal_lost_previous,man_united_won_previous
arsenal[0.35432]  man_united[0.24733]  tie[0.39833]
--------------------------------------------------

In the first case, ManU looks like the clear winner, but in the second
it looks like it will be a tie, though Arsenal looks to have more of a
chance at winning it than ManU.

(For those who don't know, Beckham, Scholes, and Neville or ManU
players and Ferguson is the coach, while Henry, Kanu, and Parlour are
Arsenal players with Wengler as their coach.  By "Beckham=false" I
mean that Beckham won't play this game.)

Also, try this on the test files:

> java Predict gameLocation.test
> java Predict football.test

Go ahead and modify the data to experiment with how the results can
vary depending on the input to training.  There isn't much data, so
its not a full-fledge example of maxent, but it should still give the
general idea.  Also, add more contexts in the test files to see what
the model will produce with different features active.

On a side note, though the features appear in almost the same
orderings in the data files, this is not important. You can list them
in whatever order you like.

You can also play around with the smoothing option by setting the
boolean value USE_SMOOTHING to "true" in CreateModel.java.  This makes
a difference in performance on the gameLocation decision.  In
particular, when the only feature available is "Rainy" for a
decision.  So, try training the model with smoothing and without
smoothing, and then testing it on "gameLocation.test" for both models
to see the difference for the input "Rainy".

If you have any suggestions, interesting modifications, or data sets
for other examples to add to this sample maxent application, please
