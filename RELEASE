1.2.0
-----
Changed license to LGPL.

Added build.xml file to be used with the build tool Jakarta Ant.

Work sponsored by Electric Knowledge:
    Added BasicEnglishAffixes class to perform basic morphological
    stemming for English.

Fixed a bug pointed out by Chieu Hai Leong in which the model would
not train properly in situations where the number of features was
constant (and therefore, no correction features need to be computed).

The top level package name has changed from quipu to opennlp.  Thus,
what was "quipu.maxent" is now "opennlp.maxent".  See
http://www.opennlp.com for more details.

Lots of little tweaks to reduce memory consumption.

Several changes sponsored by eTranslate Inc:

  * The new opennlp.maxent.io subpackage.  The input/output system for
    models is now designed to facilitate storing and retrieving of
    models in different formats.  At present, GISModelReaders and
    GISModelWriters have been supplied for reading and writing plain
    text and binary files and either can be gzipped or
    uncompressed. The OldFormatGISModelReader can be used to read old
    models (from Maxent 1.0), and also provides command line
    functionality to convert old models to a new format.  Also,
    SuffixSensitiveGISModelReader and SuffixSensitiveGISModelWriter
    have been provided to allow models to be stored and retrieved
    appropriated based on the suffixes on their file names.

  * Model training no longer automatically persists the new model to
    disk.  Instead it returns a GISModel object which can then be
    persisted using an object from one of the GISModelWriter classes.

  * Model training now relies on EventStreams rather than
    EventCollectors.  An EventStream is fed to the DataIndexer
    directly without the developer needing to invoke the DataIndex
    class explicitly.  A good way to feed an EventStream the data it
    needs to form events is to use a DataStream that can return
    Objects from a data source in a format and os-independent
    manner. An implementation of the DataStream interface for reading
    plain text files line by line is provide in the
    opennlp.maxent.PlainTextByLineDataStream class.

    In order to retain backwards compatability, the
    EventCollectorAsStream class is provided as a wrapper over the
    EventCollectors used in Maxent 1.0.  

  * GISModel is now thread-safe.  Thus, one maxent application can
    service multiple evaluations in parallel with a single model.

  * The opennlp.maxent.ModelReplacementManager class has been added to
    allow a maxent application to replace its current maxent model
    with a newly trained one in a thread-safe manner without stopping
    the servicing of requests.

    An alternative to the ModelReplacementManager is to use a
    DomainToModelMap object to record the mapping between different
    data domains to models which are optimized for them.  This class
    allows models to be swapped in a thread-safe manner as well.

  * The GIS class now is a factory which invokes a new GISTrainer
    whenever a new model is being trained.  Since GISTrainer has only
    local variables and methods, multiple models can be trained
    simultaneously on different threads.  With the previous
    implementation, requests to train new models were forced to queue
    up.

1.0
_____
Reworked the GIS algorithm to use efficient data structures
   * Tables matching things like predicates, probabilities, correction
     values to their outcomes now use OpenIntDoubleHashMaps.
   * Several functions over OpenIntDoubleHashMaps are now defined,
     and most of the work of the iteration loop is in fact done by
     these.

Events with the same outcome and contextual predicates are collapsed
to reduce the number of tokens which must be iterated through in
several loops.  The number of times each event "type" is seen is then
stored in an array (numTimesEventSeen) to provide the proper values.

GISModel uses less memory for models with many outcomes, and is much
faster on them as well.  Performance is roughly the same for models
with only two outcomes.

More code documentation.

Fully compatible with models built using version 0.2.0.
