1.2.10
------

Added error message to TrainEval's eval() method. (Jason)


1.2.9 (Bug fix release)
_____

Modified the cutoff loop in DataIndexer to use the increment() method
of TObjectIntHashMap. (Jason)

Fixed a bug (found by Chieu Hai Leong) in which the correctionConstant
of GISModel was an int that was used in division.  Now,
correctionConstant is a double. (Jason)


1.2.8
_____

Modified GISTrainer to use the new increment() and adjustValue()
methods available in Trove 0.1.4 hashmaps. (Jason)

Set up the GISTrainer to use an initial capacity and load factor for
the big hashmaps it uses.  The initial capacity is half the number of
outcomes, and the load factor is 0.9. (Jason)

(opennlp.maxent.DataIndexer)  Do not index events with 0 active features.
(Eric)

Upgraded trove dependency to 0.1.1 (includes TIntArrayList, with reset()) 
(Eric)

(opennlp.maxent.DataIndexer)
Refactored event count computation so that the cutoff can be applied while
events are read.  This obviates the need for a separate pass over the
predicates between event count computation and indexing.  It also saves
memory by reducing the amount of temporary data needed and by avoiding
creation of instances of the Counter class.  the applyCutoff() method
was no longer needed and so is gone. (Eric)

(opennlp.maxent.DataIndexer)
Made the event count computation + cutoff application also handle the
assignment of unique indexes to predicates that "make the cut."  This
saves a fair amount of time in the indexing process. (Eric)

(opennlp.maxent.DataIndexer)
Refactored the indexing implementation so that TIntArrayLists are 
(re-)used for constructing the array of predicate references associated
with each ComparableEvent.  Using the TIntArrayList instead of an
ArrayList of Integers dramatically reduces the amount of garbage
produced during indexing; it's also smaller. (Eric)

(opennlp.maxent.DataIndexer)
removed toIntArray() method, since TIntArrayList provides the same
behavior without the cost of a loop over a List of Integers (Eric)

(opennlp.maxent.DataIndexer)
changed indexing Maps to TObjectIntHashMaps to save space in several
places. (Eric)

1.2.6
-----
Summary: efficiency improvements for model training.

Removed Colt dependency in favor of GNU Trove. (Eric)

Refactored index() method in DataIndexer so that only one pass over the
list of events is needed.  This saves time (of course) and also space,
since it's no longer necessary to allocate temporary data structures to
share data between two loops. (Eric)

Refactored sorting/merging algorithm for ComparableEvents so that
merging can be done in place.  This makes it possible to merge without
copying duplicate events into sublists and so improves the indexer's
ability to work on large data sets with a reasonable amount of memory.
There is still more to be done in this department, however. (Eric)

The output directory of the build structure is now "output" instead of
"build". (Jason)

1.2.4
-----
Added options for doing *very* simple smoothing, in which we 'observe'
features that we didn't actually see in the training data.  Seems to
improve performance for models with small data sets and only a few
outcomes, though it conversely appears to degrade those with lots of
data and lots of outcomes.

Added BasicEventStream and BasicContextGenerator classes which assume
that the contextual predicates and outcomes are just sitting pretty in
lines.  This allows the events to be stored in a file and then read in
for training without scanning around producing the events everytime.

Added sample application "sports" to help with testing model behavior
and to act as an example to help newbies use the toolkit and build
their own maxent applications.

Fixed bug in TrainEval in which the number of iterations and the
cutoff were swapped in the call to train the model.

PerlHelp and BasicEnglishAffixes classes were moved out of Maxent so
that gnu-regexp.jar is no longer needed.


1.2.2
-----
Added "exe" to build.xml to create stand alone jar files. Also added
structure and "homepage" target so that it is easier to keep homepage
up-to-date.

Added IntegerPool, which manages a pool of shareable, read-only Integer 
objects in a fixed range. This is used in several places where Integer 
objects were previously created and then GCed.

In various places, used Collections API features to speed things up. 
For example, java.util.List.toArray() will do a System.arraycopy, if 
given a big enough array to copy into. This is, therefore, much
faster.

Added getAllOutcomes() method in GISModel to show the String names of
all outcomes matched up with their normalized probabilities.


1.2.0
-----
Changed license to LGPL.

Added build.xml file to be used with the build tool Jakarta Ant.

Work sponsored by Electric Knowledge:
    Added BasicEnglishAffixes class to perform basic morphological
    stemming for English.

Fixed a bug pointed out by Chieu Hai Leong in which the model would
not train properly in situations where the number of features was
constant (and therefore, no correction features need to be computed).

The top level package name has changed from quipu to opennlp.  Thus,
what was "quipu.maxent" is now "opennlp.maxent".  See
http://www.opennlp.com for more details.

Lots of little tweaks to reduce memory consumption.

Several changes sponsored by eTranslate Inc:

  * The new opennlp.maxent.io subpackage.  The input/output system for
    models is now designed to facilitate storing and retrieving of
    models in different formats.  At present, GISModelReaders and
    GISModelWriters have been supplied for reading and writing plain
    text and binary files and either can be gzipped or
    uncompressed. The OldFormatGISModelReader can be used to read old
    models (from Maxent 1.0), and also provides command line
    functionality to convert old models to a new format.  Also,
    SuffixSensitiveGISModelReader and SuffixSensitiveGISModelWriter
    have been provided to allow models to be stored and retrieved
    appropriated based on the suffixes on their file names.

  * Model training no longer automatically persists the new model to
    disk.  Instead it returns a GISModel object which can then be
    persisted using an object from one of the GISModelWriter classes.

  * Model training now relies on EventStreams rather than
    EventCollectors.  An EventStream is fed to the DataIndexer
    directly without the developer needing to invoke the DataIndex
    class explicitly.  A good way to feed an EventStream the data it
    needs to form events is to use a DataStream that can return
    Objects from a data source in a format and os-independent
    manner. An implementation of the DataStream interface for reading
    plain text files line by line is provide in the
    opennlp.maxent.PlainTextByLineDataStream class.

    In order to retain backwards compatability, the
    EventCollectorAsStream class is provided as a wrapper over the
    EventCollectors used in Maxent 1.0.  

  * GISModel is now thread-safe.  Thus, one maxent application can
    service multiple evaluations in parallel with a single model.

  * The opennlp.maxent.ModelReplacementManager class has been added to
    allow a maxent application to replace its current maxent model
    with a newly trained one in a thread-safe manner without stopping
    the servicing of requests.

    An alternative to the ModelReplacementManager is to use a
    DomainToModelMap object to record the mapping between different
    data domains to models which are optimized for them.  This class
    allows models to be swapped in a thread-safe manner as well.

  * The GIS class now is a factory which invokes a new GISTrainer
    whenever a new model is being trained.  Since GISTrainer has only
    local variables and methods, multiple models can be trained
    simultaneously on different threads.  With the previous
    implementation, requests to train new models were forced to queue
    up.

1.0
_____
Reworked the GIS algorithm to use efficient data structures
   * Tables matching things like predicates, probabilities, correction
     values to their outcomes now use OpenIntDoubleHashMaps.
   * Several functions over OpenIntDoubleHashMaps are now defined,
     and most of the work of the iteration loop is in fact done by
     these.

Events with the same outcome and contextual predicates are collapsed
to reduce the number of tokens which must be iterated through in
several loops.  The number of times each event "type" is seen is then
stored in an array (numTimesEventSeen) to provide the proper values.

GISModel uses less memory for models with many outcomes, and is much
faster on them as well.  Performance is roughly the same for models
with only two outcomes.

More code documentation.

Fully compatible with models built using version 0.2.0.
